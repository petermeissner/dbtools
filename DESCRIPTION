Description: Provides tooling around database querying and using DBI compliant
    packages. The aim of the package is to make data base interaction and SQL 
    code generation more convenient and robust. Thus the package aims to provide
    wrappers and helpers that enhance already existing tools from packages like
    DBI and glue and to bundle some database interaction utility functions in 
    one place.
